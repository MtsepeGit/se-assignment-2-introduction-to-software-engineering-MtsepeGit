# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
Is the branch of computer science that deals with design. development, maintenance and testing of software applications
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
is the cost-effective and time-efficient process that development teams use to design and build high-quality software
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. 
Provide a brief description of each phase.
a)Planning: this involves defining the softwares scope and purpose. It is a route that is about to be taken, showing the direction. b)Requirements analysis:  This stage is usually done concurently with the first one it basically highlights the required material for the software. c)Design and Prototype: This stage determines how the software programme will work, the designers decide on the programme language, layoutand other relrvent documentation. d)Software development: here the actual work begins where developers design the coding task if its a huge project multiple developers work on the coding task together. e)Testing: This usually happens at the same time with software development because designers will be testing their code while developing the software. f)Deployment: The deployment process starts once the testing phase is over and there are no bugs or errors in the development backlog. g)Maintenance: the team now thinks about the plan for upgrade.

The team ensures that the software is up-to-date and secure enough for users and pushes it from the development environment to a live environment–usually an app store.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? Waterfall Model: A step-by-step method where each stage must be finalized prior to the commencement of the subsequent one. Agile Methodology: Focuses on flexibility and customer satisfaction by continuously delivering functional software components.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle. Is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design process
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?is aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the components of a system
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Unit Testing: In this type of testing, errors are detected individually from every component or unit by individually testing the components or units of software to ensure that they are fit for use by the developers. It is the smallest testable part of the software.
Integration Testing: In this testing, two or more modules which are unit tested are integrated to test i.e., technique interacting components, and are then verified if these integrated modules work as per the expectation or not, and interface errors are also detected.
System Testing: In system testing, complete and integrated Softwares are tested i.e., all the system elements forming the system are tested as a whole to meet the requirements of the system.
Acceptance Testing: This is a kind of testing conducted to ensure that the requirements of the users are fulfilled before its delivery and that the software works correctly in the user’s working environment.
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
 Are the systems that controls and manages the changes in codes    examples are: Git, Apache Subversion, GNU Bazaar
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
To writing the project proposal, project cost estimation, scheduling, project staffing and to lias with the development team and the other stakeholders in a software project 
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
 is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. Activities include correcting issues or bugs
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? the ethical issues include, personal data, intellectual property and training. Software engineers have to be as proffestional as posssible in their jobs 
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
